# React Forms Examples

This directory contains standalone HTML files demonstrating form handling in React without any build tools. Each example uses React and Babel loaded directly in the browser.

## Files:

- **bitestateReact.html**: Form with multiple inputs using a single state object
- **userAgeReact.html**: Age verification form with conditional rendering based on input
- **userInputReact.html**: Simple name form with form submission handling

## Core Concepts Demonstrated:

- Form handling in React
- Controlled components (inputs tied to React state)
- Form submission with preventDefault()
- State management using React hooks
- Object state updates with spread operator

## How to Use:

Simply open any HTML file in a browser to see the React form in action. No server or build process required.
